There’s no single correct approach or solution to a design problem.

The sequence of steps to build large-scale distributed systems.
    
    1. **Determine system requirements and constraints:** 
        Initially, clarify the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Understanding the constraints is crucial as they influence the overall system design, including budgetary limitations and hardware specifications.
    
    2. Recognize components:
         Based on the requirements, select appropriate components, technologies, or APIs for the system design. This could involve choosing storage solutions, databases, or networking protocols that fit the system’s needs.
    
    3. Generate design:
         With the components identified, create a design that outlines how these components interact and work together to meet the system’s requirements. This includes the architecture and data flow diagrams.
    
    4. Identify shortcomings in the initial design: 
        Review the initial design to spot any limitations or issues. This step involves critical analysis to find areas for improvement or alternative solutions that could enhance the system’s efficiency or performance.
    
    5. Discuss trade-offs and improve iteratively:
         Finally, refine the design by discussing potential trade-offs. This involves balancing different aspects such as cost, performance, and scalability to optimize the design. Iterative improvements are made based on feedback and further analysis.
